# Hello-World
This is the first attempt at creating my own repository and figuring out how it works. I think I get the hang of it but I am not too sure. This is going to be fun, I will be learning a lot and very soon I will even be better than Joey. I am going to learn  a whole lot on this project and I am so excited!
